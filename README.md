# BlueLily
A High-Performance, Customizable Flight Computer for High-Powered Rocketry, Payloads, and CubeSats

### **Project Goal**
BlueLily is designed as a **versatile flight computer** tailored for **high-powered rocketry**, **payloads**, and **CubeSats**. Its primary objectives are to:
- **Collect and process real-time sensor data** (temperature, IMU, ADC readings) for flight monitoring.
- **Facilitate robust, multi-method communication** (RS485, CANBUS, Bluetooth, LoRa) for telemetry and remote control.
- **Log comprehensive flight data** to SD and flash storage for post-flight analysis.
- **Control actuators** (relays, PWM devices) autonomously or remotely from a ground station.
- **Provide an interactive user interface** via buttons, potentiometer, LEDs, and an OLED display.
- **Ensure reliability and flexibility** through a modular design, state machine-based flight logic, and runtime configurability.

Built around the **Teensy 4.1 microcontroller**, BlueLily integrates advanced sensors, communication protocols, dual storage, actuation mechanisms, and a human interface device (HID) system, all orchestrated by a sophisticated flight controller.

### **Implementation Details**
- **Teensy 4.1:** High-performance microcontroller with ample I/O and processing power.
- **Modular Design:** Each module (`Sensors`, `Communication`, etc.) is enableable/disableable via `Config.h`.
- **State Machine:** Driven by sensor thresholds (e.g., 20 m/s² for liftoff) and time, with runtime override capability.
- **Data Flow:**
  - Sensors → FlightController → Logger/Communication/HID/Actuation.
  - Ground station commands → Communication → Configurator → FlightController/Actuation.
- **Pending Features:**
  - `loadScheduleFromSD()`: Load actuator schedules from SD (`schedule.txt`).
  - Barometric altitude integration for precise height measurement.
